The <body> contains the main content of the page, including a form for user input and a footer for additional information and links.
Form Section
The form is set to submit data to a server-side script (login2) using the POST method.
An Amazon logo, which is also a clickable link to the homepage (index.html), is displayed at the top.
The main container (login-container) houses the form elements:
A title "Sign in".
A label and input field for the user’s email or mobile phone number.
A submit button styled with a yellow background, matching Amazon's branding, and other styling attributes to enhance its appearance.
Additional Information and Links

A section for business customers encourages users to shop on Amazon Business.
The "New to Amazon?" section prompts new users to create an account, providing a styled button that links to the signup page (signup.html).
Footer
The footer includes three links: Conditions of Use, Privacy Notice, and Help, providing users with quick access to important information.
A copyright notice indicates the website’s affiliation with Amazon.
Accessibility and Usability
